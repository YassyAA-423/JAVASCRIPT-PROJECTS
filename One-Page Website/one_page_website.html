            “We like novelty, something that departs from our everyday experience,” he said. “Some of the

        <p class="p2">What is horror?... And why does a good chunk of humanity enjoy it? That has
            been asked and generally studied throughout the years….<br><br>
            ... But we are actually not going to answer that here… Instead, we are here
            to show a little love to some
            not-so-well-known works of horror.</p>

            <h2>Different Forms of Horror</h2>
            <p>Horror can come in many forms. Honestly, it's amazing just how creative
                people can be when it comes to this. But my goal for this is to show examples of media that you may not
                have heard much about
                (and if you do, that's great!). I'll still mention a few big names here and there, but I won't be using
                them
                as the actual example. </p>

                <h2>Board Games</h2>
                <p>You probably weren't expecting to see board games involved in
                    this genre, but there are
                    surprisingly quite a few. And no, I am not talking about the dreaded "Perfection Game" by
                    Hasbro. That ticking still spikes up my anxiety… In this case, I'm talking about horror
                    board
                    games that use tension in a more creative way.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Black mold was created by Terrible Games. Between 2 - 5 people
                    can play. In this board game, you
                    play as prisoners who have been abandoned during a fungal infection. Your goal is to escape
                    this
                    underground prison, but during your turn, you have to hold your breath (or use the 60-second
                    sand timer) to stumble your way through this labyrinth. But be careful… the longer you stay,
                    the
                    higher the chance you get infected… becoming one of the monsters lurking in this
                    prison.<small>(Also highly recommend "The Night cage")</small></p>

                <h2>Video Games</h2>
                <p>An obvious form of horror is video games, it can be subtle
                    psychological horror games like "Night
                    in the Woods" to Survival Horror games like "Resident Evil". These are wonderful examples of
                    horror because you have to be involved! Your decisions influence whether you will get a good or
                    bad ending. </p>

                    can control the character's
                    expression. In this game, you mostly play a character called William. Something strange is
                    happening around you, and you are a suspect in Tanya's Disappearance. Throughout the gameplay,
                    your choices are based on the character's expression. You can't help but feel unsettled as you
                    play through.. Finding clues to what happened… who and how Lila is connected in all this.</p>

                <h2>Story-Telling</h2>
                <p>The most well-known form of horror is, of course, storytelling—originally passed down by word of
                    mouth.
                    This form has evolved and been better preserved through writing and recording. Books like "Scary
                    Stories
                    to Tell in the Dark" by Alvin Schwartz, websites such as "Creepypasta.com", and podcasts like
                    "Wake
                    of
                    Corrosion" all continue this long tradition of sharing frightening tales.</p>

                <p>"Radio Silence" by Bencbarlett, read by MrCreepyPasta, is a short 5-minute
                    story. Though it is short, it
                    gives a what-if answer to the question "What if we're not alone?". By the time it's done, you're
                    left
                    feeling unsettled...</p>

                <h2>Scary movies</h2>
                <p>If anything, Horror films in general a very popular way to consume this
                    genre. From the grief-horror like
                    "The Babadook" directed by Jennifer Kent to Classics like "Psycho" directed by Alfred Hitchcock. For
                    this one, we'll focus on Short films. There are tons of wonderful horror short films that explore
                    and
                    take more risks than big-screen films.</p>

                <p>Now I do have a few favorite short horror films. I narrowed it down to this
                    one for one reason... The
                    ending. Not to spoil too much, but “Safe Haven” by Martin Stalker is about a family who is
                    trying to
                    survive a post-apocalyptic climate disaster. It's roughly 16 minutes, but if you want a
                    "sit-at-the-edge-of-your-seat" short film, I highly recommend this one. <small>(I also highly
                        recommend
                        "All You Can Carry" by Andrew Rose)</small>

                And
                remember that Horror doesn't mean you have to go through it alone. It's always much more fun… <small>
